# Configuration

Every setting the package reads, where the file lives, and what happens when a value is
wrong.

## The config file

```
~/.config/rpiv-ask-user-question/config.json
```

The file is optional — with no config at all, every setting takes its default. This
package only ever *reads* the file; it never creates, writes or chmods it, so its
permissions are whatever you give it.

A complete example:

```json
{
  "collapseKey": "alt+o",
  "guidance": {
    "promptSnippet": "Ask me before guessing on anything ambiguous",
    "promptGuidelines": [
      "Batch every clarifying question into one ask_user_question call.",
      "Put your recommended option first and suffix it with (Recommended)."
    ]
  }
}
```

### Where the file is looked up

1. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rpiv-ask-user-question/config.json`, if `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set,
   non-empty and absolute. A leading `~` is expanded first; a relative value is ignored.
   Unset or ignored, the directory falls back to `~/.config`.
2. If that file does not exist, the legacy path `~/.config/rpiv-ask-user-question/config.json`
   is read. This path deliberately ignores `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, so an existing config keeps
   working after you set the variable.
3. Neither present: all defaults.

If the XDG-path file exists, its result wins even when it is malformed — there is no
second chance at the legacy path.

### When the file is invalid

Malformed JSON is not fatal. The loader warns on stderr and continues with defaults:

```
rpiv-config: invalid JSON at <path>, using default ({}) — <parser message>
```

Valid JSON that is not an object (a string, number, `null`, or an array) is rejected too,
falling back to defaults — but silently, with no warning. Individual keys with the wrong
type are likewise dropped back to their default without a warning.

## Settings

| Setting | What it does | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `collapseKey` | Key that collapses and expands the active questionnaire component. | `"ctrl+]"` |
| `guidance.promptSnippet` | One-line snippet describing the tool in the system prompt. | built-in snippet |
| `guidance.promptGuidelines` | List of usage guidelines given to the model. | 4 built-in guidelines |

### `collapseKey`

The value uses Pi's keybinding id format: zero or more distinct modifiers from `ctrl`,
`shift`, `alt`, `super`, joined by `+`, followed by a base key. Values are trimmed and
lowercased before matching.

The base key is either a single printable character from
`a-z 0-9 _ - ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) | ~ \` ' " : ; , . / < > ? [ ] { } = \`, or one of the
named keys `escape`, `esc`, `enter`, `return`, `tab`, `space`, `backspace`, `delete`,
`insert`, `clear`, `home`, `end`, `pageup`, `pagedown`, `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`,
`f1`–`f12`.

Examples that work: `"ctrl+]"`, `"alt+o"`, `"ctrl+shift+h"`, `"f9"`, `"ctrl+}"`.

Set `"off"` (any casing) to disable the collapse shortcut entirely.

A spec that does not match the grammar is rejected and the default is used. This is
strict on purpose: Pi's parser takes the last `+`-separated part as the key and ignores
unknown parts, so a typo like `"ctr+]"` could otherwise match every bare `]` keypress.

One known rough edge: the footer hint line inside the dialog always reads `Ctrl+] to
collapse` and does not interpolate a custom `collapseKey`.

### `guidance.promptSnippet` and `guidance.promptGuidelines`

These replace the text Pi puts in the system prompt about when to reach for
`ask_user_question`. Use them to make the model ask more or less often, or to enforce a
house style for options.

`promptSnippet` is used only when it is a non-empty string. `promptGuidelines` is used
only when it is a non-empty array whose entries are all non-empty strings. Anything else
falls back to the built-in defaults. Both are read once, when the extension registers the
tool, so changes take effect on the next Pi restart.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | Relocates the config directory, as described above. Must be absolute. |

`LANG` and `LC_ALL` influence the dialog language, but they are read by
[`@juicesharp/rpiv-i18n`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@juicesharp/rpiv-i18n) rather than
by this package — see [localization.md](./localization.md).

No other environment variables are read. The package makes no model calls, so it needs no
API keys or model settings of its own.
