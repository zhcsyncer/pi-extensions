# @zhcsyncer/pi-extensions

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- c1bafff: Add the `pi-tool-display-intent` extension and include it in the root bundle. The new package combines compact tool rendering with model-written, RPC-visible intent phrases without an extra inference request, preserves deterministic TUI metadata, keeps intent examples in model context for reliable follow-up calls, provides deterministic fallbacks and an optional Claude Code-inspired TUI style, sanitizes outgoing display text, and provides a cooperative custom-tool wrapper. Its built-in intent configuration uses the focused `toolIntent.enabled`, `toolIntent.language`, and `toolIntent.maxLength` surface, with enabled intent always required and visible in TUI and legacy `displaySummary` config migrated on load. Model-written intent uses the theme's primary text color for stronger contrast, while deterministic fallback intent remains muted. Output profiles only update read/search/MCP/bash density and preserve style, intent, ownership, diff, and advanced preferences; the separate reset command restores complete defaults.

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 5709a8a: Use the editor widget as the sole persistent recap surface, remove the footer display mode and duplicate success notification, keep manual generation in its cancellable loader, and persistently clean up legacy display config fields.

## 0.1.3

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 24abac8: Improve the recap widget hierarchy, restore it after reload, and show a cancellable loading indicator while generating manual recaps.
